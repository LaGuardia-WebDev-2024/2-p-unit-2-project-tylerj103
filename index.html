<h1>Top 10 Fictional Places I Would Visit</h1>
<h2>Truffula Forest, The Lorax</h2>

<p>Trufulla Forest would be an amazing place to visit, with its unique vibrant trees that are sphere shaped looking almost like wool or cotton. Imagine laying in a forest full of colorful cotton trees. Even sleeping on one of the "leaves" of this tree would be heavenly.</p>

<h2>Oz, The Wizard of Oz</h2>

<p>Oz's colors would be a sight to see. Comparing it to where dorothy came from, her world which is our world was dull and dim, Oz was extremely bright, with fields of flower, a golden road, and a city made of emerald. Only problems with Oz is that there was corruption within the world of oz, however you could still enjoy yourself while here.</p>

    <p> The Bayou's of New Orleans is a real place, however I am speaking specifically of the one from Princess in the Frog. Especially for a romantic date, rowing a boat in the swamp with a sky illuminated by fireflies, with huge trees looming over you, while you row through the swamp.</p>
<h2>Mushroom Kingdom, Super Mario</h2>

<p>The Mushroom Kingdom, is filled with Huge Mushroom Trees, regular trees, beautiful waters with exotic fishes. Some of the mushrooms in the forest give you powers like the ability t</p>
<h2>Bellchime Trail & Bell Tower, Pokemon Gold</h2>

<p> The Bellchime Trail & Bell Tower are always in a constant autumn/fall season, which I might've chosen based of my bias towards the season. However the beautiful red, orange and yellow trees with their leaves falling with the huge tower at the end of the trail overlooking the entire forest has a beautiful vibe and is greatly underappreciated.</p>
<h2>Tree House, KND</h2>
